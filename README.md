This pipeline is an adaptation of a core version available at https://github.com/verathor14/ukbio_pipeline. This has several additional processing steps and a large set of covariates suitable to adapt to various processing piplines for UK Biobank data
The core pipeline repo contains a word file with an extensive description of each processing step and how it works.
